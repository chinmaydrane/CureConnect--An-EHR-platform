1.Verify a block by block _id:
node verifyBlock.js block 692ee3b27620b305f3d6f164
# Output will show stored vs recomputed hash and print OK or MISMATCH


2.Verify a report by report _id:
node verifyBlock.js report 692ee3b27620b305f3d6f15f
# This finds report.blockHash, finds the block with that hash, recomputes, and reports match/mismatch


3.Verify chain integrity from index 0 (full chain):

node verifyBlock.js chain-from 0
# Checks hashes and previousHash pointers for all blocks >= 0
